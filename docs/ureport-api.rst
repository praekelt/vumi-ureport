.. UReport API for Vumi USSD sandbox application

UReport JSON HTTP API
=====================

This API is designed for the Vumi USSD sandbox application but the
intention is that the API should be fairly generic in the hope that it
will be usuable by other applications in future.

The API is intended to cover the following parts of U-Report
functionality:

* Registering a UReporter
* Completing a poll
* Submitting poll results
* Viewing poll results
* Submitting a report

Request responses and bodies are all JSON encoded.

One of the initial backends will be voice with IVR.

Response format overview
------------------------

All response bodies will be JSON formatted and contain objects with at
least a key named ``success``. If the HTTP response code was in the
``200`` range, the value of ``success`` will be ``true``. Otherwise,
the value will be ``false``.

**Example response (success)**:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "success": true,
     ...
   }

**Example response (error)**:

.. sourcecode:: http

   HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "success": false,
     "reason": "Ureporter not found"
   }


.. _api-methods:

API methods
-----------

.. http:get:: /ureporters/(str:backend)/(str:user_address)

   Information on the given Ureporter.

   :reqheader Accept: Should be ``application/json``.
   :reqheader Authorization: Optional HTTP Basic authentication.

   :param str backend:
       The RapidSMS / U-Report backend the user is utilizing (e.g.
       ``vumi_go_ussd`` or ``vumi_go_voice``).
   :param str address:
       The address of the user (e.g. ``+256775551122``).

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``.

   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 404: no user found

   **Description of the JSON response attributes**:

   The ``registered`` parameter is ``true`` if the Ureporter has
   completed registration and ``false`` otherwise.

   The ``language`` parameter should be a two-letter language code
   as defined in ISO 639-1 or ``null`` if the Ureporter's preferred
   language is not yet known.

   .. warning::

      If anyone would like to suggest extra fields to return for the user,
      that would be useful.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /ureporters/vumi_go_sms/+256775551122
      Host: example.com
      Accept: application/json

   **Example response (success)**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json

      {

        "user": {
            "id": "1234",
            "registered": false,
            "language": "sw",

      }


.. http:get:: /ureporters/(str:backend)/(str:user_address)/polls/current

   Retrieve a decription of the current poll, or a ``null`` poll if
   no poll is currently available.

   This should return either the current registration poll if the
   Ureporter isn't registered, or the poll the Ureporter should be
   responding to now if they are registered.

   :reqheader Accept: Should be ``application/json``.
   :reqheader Authorization: Optional HTTP Basic authentication.

   :param str backend:
       The RapidSMS / U-Report backend the user is utilizing (e.g.
       ``vumi_go_ussd`` or ``vumi_go_voice``).
   :param str address:
       The address of the user (e.g. ``+256775551122``).

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``.

   :statuscode 200: no error
   :statuscode 404: no user found

   **Description of the JSON response attributes**:

   The ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` fields should be ISO 8601 and
   RFC 3339 compatible UTC timestamps or ``null``.

   Allowed values for ``response_type``:

   * ``allow_all`` (``a`` in RapidSMS polls)
   * ``allow_one`` (``o`` in RapidSMS polls)

   Allowed values for ``type``:

   * ``text`` (``t`` in RapidSMS polls)
   * ``numeric`` (``n`` in RapidSMS polls)
   * ``registration`` (``r`` in RapidSMS polls)
   * ``location`` (``l`` in RapidSMS polls)
   * ``other`` (all other RapidSMS polls)

   Updates to this API may extend the list of allowed ``type`` values.

   The ``default_response`` is the default text to send to submissions to
   this poll or ``null`` if there is no default.

   .. warning::

      We still need to add a parameter here for custom voice recordings.
      Maybe ``"wav": "http://example.com/voice/12345.wav"``? If no voice
      recording is available, Vumi will attempt to generate one.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /ureporters/vumi_go_sms/+256775551122/polls/current
      Host: example.com
